![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v2.0.0--1025-green)[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar/actions/workflows/maven.yml)[![Docker Image](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

**Caesar** is the central backend-component for managing Minecraft server networks - especially for [CloudNet v4](https://cloudnetservice.eu/). Caesar is a fast, secure and flexible application for modern Minecraft infrastructures.

> **DISCLAIMER**: Caesar is **not** web-based. You have to download the [Caesar Client](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar-Panel) to work with the backend system.
